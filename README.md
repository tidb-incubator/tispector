# PingCAP Template Project

The PingCAP Template Project is a template for starting new projects in the PingCAP incubator. All incubator projects, at minimum, must have the following files:

- a `README.md` outlining the project goals, sponsoring sig, and community contact information
- an `OWNERS` with the project leads listed as committers
- a `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining how to contribute to the project
- an unmodified copy of `code-of-conduct.md` from this repo, which outlines community behavior and the consequences of breaking the code
- a `LICENSE` which must be Apache 2.0 for code projects and documentation repositories, without any custom content
